# Data Analysis and Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest

## Description

This project involves a thorough analysis of datasets related to kilometers and devices, with a focus on detecting anomalies using the Isolation Forest algorithm. It also includes correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, and advanced statistical evaluations to identify patterns and trends across different regions and track categories.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure that you have the following tools and libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset

Make sure to have the datasets ready in the `data/` directory or update the path accordingly in the notebook. The datasets contain information on:
- Regions (Brussels, Flanders, Wallonia)
- Track categories (Main tracks, Secondary tracks)
- Year
- Kilometer
- Number of devices

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ruzgarkartali/DTSC-Technical-Test.git
   cd DTSC-Technical-Test
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)**

   It's recommended to create a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with existing packages:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/Scripts/activate # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**

   Start Jupyter Notebook to run the analysis notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Run the Notebook**

   Open the notebook file (`final.ipynb`) in your browser and execute the cells to see the data analysis, correlation studies, and anomaly detection results.

## Key Files

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files used for analysis.
- `final.ipynb`: The main notebook where the data analysis, correlation, and anomaly detection are implemented.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains the list of dependencies required to run the project.
